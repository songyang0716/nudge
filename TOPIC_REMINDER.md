# Nudge - Topic & Subject Matter Reminder

## Overview

Nudge is a spaced repetition study reminder that helps you maintain and improve your knowledge on any topic through scientifically-proven review intervals. Instead of forgetting what you've learned, Nudge reminds you exactly when to review it for optimal retention and mastery.

## The Problem with Traditional Learning

When you study a topic:
- You feel confident immediately after learning it
- Days later, you've already forgotten key concepts
- Weeks later, recalling information feels like starting from scratch

**Result:** You study more topics, but retain less knowledge.

## The Solution: Spaced Repetition

Nudge uses the **forgetting curve** principle - you review topics at scientifically-optimized intervals:

- **Day 1**: Initial study/learning
- **Day 3**: Review the concepts (2 days later)
- **Day 7**: Review again (4 days later)
- **Day 14**: Another review (7 days later)
- **Day 30**: Deep review (16 days later)
- **Day 60**: Challenge yourself again (30 days later)
- **Day 120**: Final reinforcement (60 days later)

After 120 days, the topic is marked as **"mastered"** and continues at 120-day intervals for long-term retention.

## How to Use Nudge for Any Topic

### 1. Add a Topic After Learning It

When you learn something new:

1. Open Nudge
2. Click **"Add Item"**
3. Enter the topic details:
   - **Name:** e.g., "Python Decorators", "Database Indexing", "French Subjunctive"
   - **Tags:** Use tags like:
     - `Beginner` or `Advanced` (difficulty)
     - `Python`, `Database`, `French` (subject)
     - `Week-1` (study group)

Example:
```
Item Name: Machine Learning - Neural Networks
Tags: Advanced, AI, Week-2
```

### 2. Daily Review Routine

Every morning, open Nudge and check what's due:

- **Red highlighted items:** Topics overdue for review
- **Yellow highlighted items:** Topics due today
- Review each topic and quiz yourself on key concepts
- Click **"Mark as Reviewed"** to schedule the next review

### 3. Review Tips

When reviewing a topic:

- **First review (Day 3):** Summarize key concepts from memory, review notes if needed
- **Second review (Day 7):** Teach the concept to someone else or write an explanation
- **Third review (Day 14):** Apply the knowledge in a practical scenario
- **Later reviews:** Challenge yourself with complex problems or variations

## Example Timeline

You learn **Quantum Computing Basics** on January 20, 2026:

```
Jan 20  → Add to Nudge, tagged as "Physics, Advanced"
Jan 21  → Review due (summarize concepts)
Jan 24  → Review due (teach the basics)
Jan 31  → Review due (apply to problems)
Feb 14  → Review due (deep dive into details)
Mar 16  → Review due (connect to other topics)
May 16  → Review due (mastery verification)
```

By **May 16**, you'll have internalized the concepts deeply and won't forget them.

## Tagging Strategy

Use tags to organize and filter your topics:

### By Difficulty
- `Beginner`
- `Intermediate`
- `Advanced`

### By Subject
- `Programming`, `Mathematics`, `Science`
- `History`, `Languages`, `Art`
- `Business`, `Finance`, `Health`

### By Type
- `Theory`, `Practical`, `Hands-on`
- `Reading`, `Video`, `Project`

### By Goal
- `Interview-Prep`
- `Career-Development`
- `Study-Week-1`, `Study-Week-2`
- `Certification`

## Benefits

✅ **Scientifically Optimal:** Based on proven memory retention research

✅ **Save Time:** Review only what you need to remember, when you need to review

✅ **Build Confidence:** Master topics instead of just learning them once

✅ **Track Progress:** See your learning timeline and mastery status

✅ **Reduce Anxiety:** Know exactly what to study each day

## Sample Workflow

### Week 1: Topic Collection
```
Mon: Learn Topic A, B, C → Add all three to Nudge
Tue: Learn Topic D, E → Add both to Nudge
Wed: Learn Topic F, G → Add both to Nudge
Thu: Learn Topic H, I → Add both to Nudge
Fri: Review Day 1 (due tomorrow for all)
```

### Week 2: Mixed Learning + Reviews
```
Mon: Review topics from Monday (Day 3)
     Learn new topics
Tue: Review topics from Tuesday (Day 3)
     Learn new topics
Wed: Review topics from Wednesday (Day 3)
     Learn new topics
Thu: Review topics from Thursday (Day 3)
     Learn new topics
Fri: All reviews due - comprehensive study
```

### Ongoing Maintenance
After Week 1, your topics are scheduled automatically:
- Some due at Day 3
- Some at Day 7
- Some at Day 14
- etc.

Nudge handles the scheduling - just check what's due each day!

## Comparison: Before vs After Nudge

### Before Nudge
- Learn 100 topics → Remember 10
- Time spent: 50 hours
- Retention: 10%

### With Nudge
- Learn 100 topics → Master 80+
- Time spent: 60 hours (10 more hours reviewing)
- Retention: 80%+

**The extra 10 hours of strategic review yields 8x better retention!**

## Getting Started Today

1. **Study or learn something new**
2. **Open Nudge and add it** with appropriate difficulty and subject tags
3. **Tomorrow:** Review it when Nudge reminds you
4. **Follow the pattern** and watch your knowledge retention improve

## Notes

- Start with topics you find challenging - those benefit most from spaced repetition
- Don't review early - the intervals are optimized for memory retention
- If you miss a review, just review when you can - the next interval starts from that date
- Use the tags feature to focus on specific subjects during your study sessions

**Remember:** It's not about learning more topics. It's about remembering the ones you learn. Nudge makes that happen automatically.

Happy studying! 🎓
