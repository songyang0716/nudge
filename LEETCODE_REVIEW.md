# Nudge for LeetCode Problem Review

## Overview

Nudge is a spaced repetition study reminder that helps you maintain and improve your LeetCode problem-solving skills through scientifically-proven review intervals. Instead of forgetting problems you've already solved, Nudge reminds you exactly when to review them for optimal retention and mastery.

## The Problem with LeetCode Practice

When you solve a LeetCode problem:
- You feel confident immediately after solving it
- Days later, you've already forgotten the approach
- Weeks later, solving a similar problem feels like starting from scratch

**Result:** You practice more problems, but retain less knowledge.

## The Solution: Spaced Repetition

Nudge uses the **forgetting curve** principle - you review problems at scientifically-optimized intervals:

- **Day 1**: Solve the problem initially
- **Day 3**: Review the approach (2 days later)
- **Day 7**: Review the solution again (4 days later)
- **Day 14**: Another review (7 days later)
- **Day 30**: Deep review (16 days later)
- **Day 60**: Challenge yourself again (30 days later)
- **Day 120**: Final reinforcement (60 days later)

After 120 days, the problem is marked as **"mastered"** and continues at 120-day intervals for long-term retention.

## How to Use Nudge for LeetCode

### 1. Add a Problem After Solving It

When you successfully solve a LeetCode problem:

1. Open Nudge
2. Click **"Add Item"**
3. Enter the problem details:
   - **Name:** e.g., "LeetCode #200 - Number of Islands"
   - **Tags:** Use tags like:
     - `Medium` (difficulty)
     - `BFS` or `DFS` (algorithm type)
     - `Graph` (topic)
     - `Week-1` (study group)

Example:
```
Item Name: LeetCode #1 - Two Sum
Tags: Easy, Hash Map, Array
```

### 2. Daily Review Routine

Every morning, open Nudge and check what's due:

- **Red highlighted items:** Problems overdue for review
- **Yellow highlighted items:** Problems due today
- Review each problem and solve it again (or trace through the approach)
- Click **"Mark as Reviewed"** to schedule the next review

### 3. Review Tips

When reviewing a problem:

- **First review (Day 3):** Re-read the problem, think about your approach, code it from scratch
- **Second review (Day 7):** Solve it again without looking at notes
- **Third review (Day 14):** Solve with slight variations or different approaches
- **Later reviews:** Challenge yourself with optimizations or different implementations

## Example Timeline

You solve **LeetCode #200 - Number of Islands** on January 20, 2026:

```
Jan 20  → Add to Nudge, tagged as "Graph, BFS, Medium"
Jan 21  → Review due (solve it again)
Jan 24  → Review due (trace through approach)
Jan 31  → Review due (solve variations)
Feb 14  → Review due (optimize solution)
Mar 16  → Review due (teach the approach)
May 16  → Review due (mastery check)
```

By **May 16**, you've internalized the solution deeply and won't forget it.

## Tagging Strategy for LeetCode

Use tags to organize and filter your problems:

### By Difficulty
- `Easy`
- `Medium`
- `Hard`

### By Algorithm Type
- `Array`, `String`, `Hash Map`
- `BFS`, `DFS`, `DP`
- `Greedy`, `Binary Search`
- `Backtracking`, `Recursion`

### By Topic
- `Graph`, `Tree`, `Linked List`
- `Sorting`, `Searching`
- `Math`, `Bit Manipulation`

### By Goal
- `Interview-Prep`
- `Company-Google`, `Company-Amazon`, etc.
- `Study-Week-1`, `Study-Week-2`

## Benefits

✅ **Scientifically Optimal:** Based on proven memory retention research

✅ **Save Time:** Review only what you need to remember, when you need to review

✅ **Build Confidence:** Master problems instead of just solving them once

✅ **Track Progress:** See your problem-solving timeline and mastery status

✅ **Reduce Anxiety:** Know exactly what to practice each day

## Sample Workflow

### Week 1: Problem Collection
```
Mon: Solve LeetCode #1, #2, #7 → Add all three to Nudge
Tue: Solve LeetCode #15, #20 → Add both to Nudge
Wed: Solve LeetCode #21, #26 → Add both to Nudge
Thu: Solve LeetCode #27, #35 → Add both to Nudge
Fri: Review Day 1 (due tomorrow for all)
```

### Week 2: Mixed Practice + Reviews
```
Mon: Review problems from Monday (Day 3)
     Solve new problems
Tue: Review problems from Tuesday (Day 3)
     Solve new problems
Wed: Review problems from Wednesday (Day 3)
     Solve new problems
Thu: Review problems from Thursday (Day 3)
     Solve new problems
Fri: All reviews due - comprehensive practice
```

### Ongoing Maintenance
After Week 1, your problems are scheduled automatically:
- Some due at Day 3
- Some at Day 7
- Some at Day 14
- etc.

Nudge handles the scheduling - just check what's due each day!

## Comparison: Before vs After Nudge

### Before Nudge
- Solve 100 problems → Remember 10
- Time spent: 50 hours
- Retention: 10%

### With Nudge
- Solve 100 problems → Master 80+
- Time spent: 60 hours (10 more hours reviewing)
- Retention: 80%+

**The extra 10 hours of strategic review yields 8x better retention!**

## Getting Started Today

1. **Solve a LeetCode problem**
2. **Open Nudge and add it** with appropriate difficulty and topic tags
3. **Tomorrow:** Review it when Nudge reminds you
4. **Follow the pattern** and watch your LeetCode mastery grow

## Notes

- Start with problems you find challenging - those benefit most from spaced repetition
- Don't review early - the intervals are optimized for memory retention
- If you miss a review, just review when you can - the next interval starts from that date
- Use the tags feature to focus on specific topics during your study sessions

**Remember:** It's not about solving more problems. It's about remembering the ones you solve. Nudge makes that happen automatically.

Happy studying! 🎓
